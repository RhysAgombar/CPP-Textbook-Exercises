# CPP-Textbook-Exercises
Code exercises from 'Programming Principles and Practice using C++' textbook.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is for me to play around with the exercises in the aformentioned textbook. I've already taken half a dozen proper C++ courses in my university education, so just about all of this is review for me, but I'm working through it anyway to keep my skills fresh and ensure I don't forget any important details or features of the language/its common libraries. 

Once finished with this, I intend to move on a more advanced textbook to improve my skills further, and eventually, direct myself towards CUDA programming. Given my current level of competency, I could probably have started further along, but I want to ensure that my foundation was rock solid.
